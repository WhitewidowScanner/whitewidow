         [ LEGAL DISCLAIMER ]

         I was written and created for learning purposes only, I should
         be treated as a tool to further your knowledge of how SQL queries
         work and what to look for so you don't become vulnerable, such as
         the sites you will find while using me. Using me for malicious
         purposes, including but not limited to:

                 - Blackhat database take overs, to exploit, deface, or
                   steal sensitive material.
                 - Black mailing the owners of the web pages
                 - Selling personal information found within the databases
                   of the websites discovered to be vulnerable
                 - Any and all malicious intents

         Is illegal and will not be tolerated. If you plan to use me for any
         of the listed purposes, or for any illegal activity, do not go forward
         and exit immediately.

         My owner Ekultek, takes no responsibility for the actions taken
         from the knowledge you have gained from using me.

         It is the end users responsibility to follow all laws, regulations,
         and rules of the state, territory, or country where I am being run.
